# Razorpay Orders Test Node Application

This is a web application built on Node JS to demostrate GET and POST requests using Razorpay's Orders API. 

## Getting Started

While testing this out please insert your API Key and Secret in the app.js file before running it locally on your machine. Without this step, this application would not work as expected.

### Prerequisites

You must have a Razorpay account with API Key and Secret access to use this application. 

### Installing

Step 1: Run the following command from the terminal once you've navigated to this application
```
npm install
```

Step 2: Once the dependencies are installed run the following command to launch the application
```
node app.js
```

### Deployment

This application is deployed live at https://razorpay-node-orders.herokuapp.com/ using a test API Key and Secret.
